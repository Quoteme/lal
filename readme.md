# LAL - Minimalist and pure statusbar - written 100% in Haskell

Inspired by Xmobar but without needless dependencies and extra
compilation-flags (like XFT). Designed for fast compliation times and
therefor rapid and easy development.

If you don't like some aspect, just change it or add features yourself.
The code should be understandable for anyone who read [https://wiki.haskell.org/X_window_programming_in_Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/X_window_programming_in_Haskellhttps://wiki.haskell.org/X_window_programming_in_Haskell).
